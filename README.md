# Genome-association analyses
This repository stores the R codes used to perform all the genomic analyses related to the publication of Laccetti et al: "Genomic adaptation in seed traits in a wild non-model plant species and its interaction with biotic and abiotic conditions". The study combines genome-wide association, genome-environment association and a genome-wide scan of spatial genomic differentiation to identify putative signatures of adaptation in seed traits and to climate and pollinators across 14 populations of the wild plant Brassica incana.

Sequencing data from Pacbio and Illumina used for this study are available at the ENA database (project number PRJEB54646). The bionano raw data and assembled optical maps are available at NCBI database (sample name PRJNA859008). Data on seed trait and ecological variables are provided in Supplementary material (Supplementary Data 1) of the publication.
